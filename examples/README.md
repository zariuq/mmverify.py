This directory contains some examples of the WIP MeTTaMath project to port a MM verifier into MeTTa (and then to foster mathematical reasoning experiments). 

* demo0.mm comes from the Metamath book.
* disjoint2.mm comes from the Metamath github repo tests because a disjoint variable test wsa needed.

  The .metta files are the MeTTa commands created post-parsing from the Python mmverify.py file and the calls needed to do verification.

  The .log files are the output of running the Python or MeTTa versions.
